## CSC420 Assignment 2
### MNIST classification problem

#### Download dataset

You need to first download the MNIST dataset from the official [webpage](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

In particular, you need following four files:
- [train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz):  training set images (9912422 bytes) 
- [train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz):  training set labels (28881 bytes) 
- [t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz):   test set images (1648877 bytes) 
- [t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz):   test set labels (4542 bytes)

after you download the dataset, put them into the folder `./data`:
```bash
makir data
mv train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz data/
mv train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz data/
mv t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz data/
mv t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz data/
```

#### Run the script

All the training script is maintained in the `main.py` file, which you do not need to implement. You can run the script by doing:
```bash
python main.py
```
 The main task for this problem is to implement the functions we left for you in the `mlp.py`, which defines the class for `OneLayerNN`. 
 Please read the docs for each function and implement it. You need to submit your implementation in this assignment.
