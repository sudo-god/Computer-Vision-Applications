# This repo contains computer vision applications that I did as university assignments.

## Brief overview of the tpoics/concepts covered:
- Cross correlation
- Magnitude and direction computation using gradients
- Homography transformation
- Affine transformation
- Image localization
- Seam path carving 
- Canny edge detection
- Harris corner detection
- Stereo camera depth analysis i.e. disparity calculation
- Image segmentation
- Panoramic image stitching using RANSAC
- Image feature matching using SIFT algorithm
- Image warping to calculate an objectâ€™s dimensions
- Clothing segmentation using the YOLOv5-fashion model
- Identifying book covers of multiple books in an image using K-means clustering algorithm and extracted features and descriptors.
